This code uses the data from my (Xuan) simulation called UCNASimOutput.txt
and pipes it into TTree variables/branches by running it through ttree.cc.

The output file is called xuan_analyzed.root.

However, when being fed into Michael Mendenhall's analyzer, it will be named analyzed_#.root.
The number chosen will be recorded here and will be modifed rarely.
It will be a personal flag to remind myself that analyzed_#.root actually means xuan_analyzed.root.
